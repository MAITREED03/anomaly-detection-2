    "Feature selection plays a crucial role in anomaly detection by influencing the effectiveness and efficiency of the detection process. Anomaly detection aims to identify patterns or instances that deviate significantly from the norm within a given dataset. Feature selection involves choosing a subset of relevant features from the original set of variables, and it directly impacts the quality of anomaly detection models. Here are key aspects of the role of feature selection in anomaly detection:\n",
    "1.\tDimensionality Reduction:\n",
    "•\tAnomaly detection often involves high-dimensional data. Selecting a subset of features helps in reducing the dimensionality of the dataset, which can lead to improved model performance and computational efficiency.\n",
    "2.\tNoise Reduction:\n",
    "•\tNot all features contribute equally to the detection of anomalies. Some features may contain noise or be irrelevant to the identification of abnormal patterns. Feature selection helps in eliminating irrelevant or redundant features, reducing the impact of noise and enhancing the model's sensitivity to meaningful anomalies.\n",
    "3.\tModel Interpretability:\n",
    "•\tA reduced set of features contributes to a more interpretable model. It allows for a clearer understanding of the factors influencing the anomaly detection process, aiding in the interpretation of results by domain experts.\n",
    "4.\tComputational Efficiency:\n",
    "•\tSelecting relevant features contributes to the efficiency of anomaly detection algorithms. By working with a reduced set of features, computational resources are utilized more efficiently, leading to faster model training and inference.\n",
    "5.\tImproved Generalization:\n",
    "•\tFeature selection can enhance the generalization capabilities of anomaly detection models. By focusing on the most informative features, the model is better equipped to identify anomalies in unseen data, reducing the risk of overfitting to specific patterns present in the training set.\n",
    "6.\tAddressing the Curse of Dimensionality:\n",
    "•\tAnomaly detection can be adversely affected by the curse of dimensionality, where the sparsity of data increases with the number of features. Feature selection mitigates this issue by retaining only the most relevant features, preventing the model from becoming overly complex and inefficient.\n"

The algorithm relies on the concept of isolating anomalies rather than profiling normal instances. Here is a step-by-step explanation of how global outliers can be detected using the Isolation Forest algorithm:\n",
    "1.\tRandom Subsampling (Isolation):\n",
    "•\tThe algorithm randomly selects a subset of the data.\n",

    "•\tThe intuition is that anomalies are expected to have shorter average path lengths since they require fewer splits to be isolated.\n",
    "3.\tNormalization:\n",
    "•\tTo identify outliers, the average path lengths are normalized by comparing them to the average path length of a random sample from a completely random dataset.\n",
    "•\tThis normalization step is crucial for making the algorithm invariant to the size of the dataset and to ensure a more reliable anomaly score.\n",
    "4.\tAnomaly Score and Thresholding:\n",
    "•\tAnomaly scores are assigned to each instance based on their normalized path lengths.\n",
